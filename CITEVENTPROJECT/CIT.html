          A student's time at the center will be completely based on the technology they work to understand. In their freshman and sophomore years, most of a students' core classes will be incorporated with the center, with the classes being fully composed of center peers. This structure creates the very warm and community oriented culture the center is known for. This addiontally provides a sharp focus on the center's technoogical cirriculum and the core values of integrity and respect. The skills they build and the connections they make in their early years will bolster a student's ability to suceed in later years, where they branch out in their coursework and pool of peers. The relationsips with center teachers also take center stage, as they provide students with a strong support system in their education.

In their sophomore year, students create their Consultant of the Week presentation, in whch they become experts on a particular topic in technology and teach a lesson to the class. Students also work on various real world projects within the school, organizng events such as the CIT open house and the hackathon. In their project management class, they learn the SCRUM principles, which they apply in these projects and the CIT projects in the second semester, where they work with the Juniors. Students are provided with an opprotunity to hold and internship within the field of technolgy in their Junior to Senior summer, and can choose to create a capstone projct in their final year in the center.
