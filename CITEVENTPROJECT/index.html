<td><p>Deep Run’s Center for Information Technology (CIT) strives to equip its students with the skills needed to pursue successful careers in information technology. Our curriculum prepares students with rigorous courses in computer science and develops their soft skills during their four years here. While this has produced many successful graduates, we want to educate our students further on what comes next. To do so, we have created GRIT! GRIT’s purpose is to give our students a professional conference created just for them. With the help of vendors, alumni, and college representatives it is expected that students will leave with an enhanced understanding of various paths in IT, such as education, career, and technology. GRIT will be held Friday, March 31, 2023, at the Cultural Arts Center of Glen Allen. 

Students will have the opportunity to converse with and learn from a panel of vendors, speakers, and colleges, as well as Deep Run alumni who have successfully graduated and navigated the world of IT after high school. Preparing our students in a professional setting will be both beneficial to their future and essential to making connections with others in attendance.</p></td>
